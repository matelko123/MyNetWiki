# .NET Patterns & Knowledge Base Repository

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to exploring, documenting, and demonstrating important patterns, utilities, and best practices in the .NET ecosystem.

👉 **[View Table of Contents](tableOfContents.md)**

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository is designed to serve as both a **knowledge base** and a **collection of practical, working examples** of common and useful concepts in .NET development.

Each concept is presented in its own folder, with:

* A dedicated `.NET Solution` (`.sln`) file
* A class library containing reusable logic
* A minimal Web API to demonstrate usage
* A `README.md` explaining the concept and implementation in detail

---

## 📦 What's Included

Each topic is structured to be **self-contained** so you can:

* Explore it without other dependencies
* Reuse the code in your own projects
* Understand the concept from both theoretical and practical standpoints

---

## 👨‍💻 Who is This For?

This repository is intended for:

* .NET developers looking to deepen their understanding of practical patterns
* People building maintainable, scalable systems using C#
* Anyone interested in modern software practices in .NET

Whether you're just learning or refining your architecture – this repository is a hands-on reference you can explore, learn from, and use in your projects.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each folder contains:

1. A solution with two projects:

   * A class library (core logic)
   * A Web API (demo / usage)
2. A `README.md` file to explain the concept

You can run any sample with:

```bash
cd <FolderName>/<ApiProject>
dotnet run
```
